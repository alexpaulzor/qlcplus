<H1>E1.31 input/output plugin</H1>

<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P>
QLC+ supports the <a href="http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/E1.31">E1.31 protocol</a> (also known as sACN)
through an input/output plugin that receives and transmits packets on the network.<br>
No extra requirements are needed, since QLC+ has a native implementation of the E1.31 protocol
that works on Linux, Windows and OSX systems.
</P>

<H1>Configuration</H1>

<P>
The E1.31 plugin can be configured to send and receive packets from multiple network cards, virtual addresses
and multiple universes per network card.<br>
The desired configuration can be achieved quite easily by opening the plugin configuration panel.<br>
The dialog will show all the possible choices depending on the network interfaces that QLC+ detects
when opened.<br>
The dialog will display two lists:
<ul>
 <li>The available networks and universes. Just click on the corresponding checkbox to enable
     the one you are going to use and it will be listed in QLC+ input/output manager.<br>
     Networks and universes are displayed in the following form:</li>
   <ul>
    <li>Network 1 - Universe 0</li>
    <li>Network 1 - Universe 1</li>
    <li>Network 1 - Universe 2</li>
    <li>Network 1 - Universe 3</li>
    <li>Network 2 - Universe 0</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>Network 2 - Universe 3</li>
    <li>...</li>
   </ul>
</ul>
Networks are displayed as the IP addresses of your network interfaces. It means
that E1.31 packets will be sent from those addresses, to the multicast address 239.255.0.x, 
where 'x' is the universe number.
