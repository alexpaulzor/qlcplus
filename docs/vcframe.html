<P>
A Frame is a container that can hold a variety of widgets, including other frames, inside. In
fact, the whole Virtual Console is already your bottom-most frame. Also, if you
apply some <A HREF="file:vcstylingplacement.html">styling attributes</A> to a frame,
all of its children (which have not had their own non-default style settings applied) also
inherit their parent's style properties.
</P>

<a name="configuration"><H2>Configuration</H2></a>

<P>
Frames can be configured with the properties
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png" ALIGN="bottom"> button found in the toolbar or
by double clicking the frame itself.<br><br>

Other than the standard <A HREF="file:vcstylingplacement.html">styling &amp; placement options</A>,
Frames have the following additional options, divided into 2 tabs:<br>
</P>

<a name="appearance"><H3>Appearance tab</H3></a>
<ul>
 <li><b>Frame name</b>: Allow you to assign an arbitrary label to the Frame. This will be displayed
    only when the "Show header" option is enabled (see below).</li>
 <li><b>Accept child widgets</b>: Allow you to add widgets to the Frame.</li>
 <li><b>Allow resizing</b>: Allow the Frame height and width to be changed.</li>
 <li><b>Show header</b>: Display a useful header made up of a button and a label. The button allows
    you to expand/collapse the Frame which can save a lot of Virtual Console space. The label
    will display the name of the Frame.</li>
</ul>

<a name="pages"><H3>Pages tab</H3></a>
<P>Starting from version 4.5.0, QLC+ gives the possibility of turning Virtual Console Frames 
into multi-page widgets, useful when dealing with a lot of widgets or controllers supporting pages.<br>
The multi-page functionality is disabled by default.<br>
<B>Important note: this functionality will work only with an <A HREF="file:howto-input-profiles.html">input profile</A>
with a previous page <IMG SRC="qrc:/back.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> and a
next page <IMG SRC="qrc:/forward.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">button set.</B><br>
Following these options to configure this functionality:
</P>
<ul>
 <li><b>Enable</b>: This check box enables/disables the multi-page functionality. When enabled,
     VC frames will display additional controls in the header bar (if the header bar is also enabled). 
     These are: Previous page button, page number label, next page button.
 </li>
 <li><b>Number of pages</b>: With this counter it is possible to determine the number of pages the
     frame is going to handle.
 </li>
 <li><b>Clone first page widgets</b>: When checked, QLC+ will clone the widgets of the frame's first
     page into all the other new pages defined by the "Number of pages" field. This is a very useful
     option to speed up the mapping of an external controller where all the pages have the same widgets.
 </li>
 <li><b>External input - Previous page</b>: You can set an external input signal or a 
     keyboard combination here which will cause the previous page of the frame to be displayed.
 </li>
 <li><b>External input - Next page</b>: You can set an external input signal or a 
     keyboard combination here which will cause the previous page of the frame to be displayed.
 </li>
</ul>
